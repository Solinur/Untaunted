[*]Added an option to invert the timer bars (so they shrinnk to the right)
[*]Added an option to invert the growth direction of new frames (so a new frame is added above).
[*]Added option to show markers on engaged enemies. (They work like group pins, and the only thing that can be done in the API is to select the Icon that is shown)

0.1.4: DL:580 (03.10.2016, 13:05)
[*]Updated LibAddonMenu to 2.0 r22

0.2.0: DL: 4,715 (31.12.2016, 13:51)
[*]Added individual settings per character
[*]Changed how different debuffs are tracked: Each can now be switched on and off. Instead of the skull symbol the debuff icon will now be shown.
[*]Added tracking for Infallible Aether and Siphon Spirit
[*]Note: More debuffs for tracking could be added per request. If there is a need for it I might add a way to manually add more debuffs to track. However I do not intend to increase the scope of the addon to a point where you have multiple UI areas or customizations per ability. It is supposed to be a simple addon to track a single or at most few selected debuffs)

[*]Fixed a bug where the timer would not refresh for Infallible Aether correctly.
