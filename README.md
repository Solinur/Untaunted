## Dependencies

This addon requires the following libraries:

They are included in the release and have to be enabled in the Addon panel ingame.

## Description

**Please note that the addon is still in beta so don't expect everything to be perfect.**

Untaunted is a small Addon that provides frames of enemies you have taunted and shows the remaining time the taunt still lasts. The Addon uses the data directly given trough the API and thus always knows if a taunt is still up. If you target an enemy who has a taunt running, that enemy is higlighted with a yellow border in the frames. Due to API limitations it is not possible to add this for enemies which don't have a taunt running (the taunt timing serves as a mean to uniquely identify them). 

Aside from taunts Untaunted now also tracks a range of debuffs that can help healers to keep track of some of their support responsibilities.

Full list of tracked buffs/debuffs: 

* Taunt
* Major Breach
* Minor Vulnerability
* Minor Lifesteal
* Crusher
* Off Balance
* Off Balance Immunity
* Weakening
* Aggresive Horn
* Minor Fracture (PotL)
* Minor Breach (PotL)
* Power of the Light

You can set position, width and height (= fontsize) in the options.
