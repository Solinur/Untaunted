[COLOR=DarkOrange][B]Please note that the addon is still in beta so don't expect everything to be perfect.

[/B][/COLOR] [COLOR=Yellow][B]Untaunted [/B][/COLOR]is a small Addon that provides frames of enemies you have taunted and shows the remaining time the taunt still lasts. The Addon uses the data directly given trough the API and thus always knows if a taunt is still up. If you target an enemy who has a taunt running, that enemy is higlighted with a yellow border in the frames. Due to API limitations it is not possible to add this for enemies which don't have a taunt running (the taunt timing serves as a mean to uniquely identify them). 

Aside from taunts [COLOR=Yellow][B]Untaunted [/B][/COLOR] now also tracks Elemental Drain, The Debuff from the Infallible Aether Set, Minor Vulnerability, Warhorn and Siphon Spirit. This can help healers to keep track of some of their support responsibilities.

You can set position, width and height (= fontsize) in the options.

Let me know if you like it and if you have features you miss.
